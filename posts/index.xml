Abstract Link to heading Cooking tasks are characterized by large changes in the state of the food, which is one of the major challenges in robot execution of cooking tasks. In particular, cooking using a stove to apply heat to the foodstuff causes many special state changes that are not seen in other tasks, making it difficult to design a recognizer.</description></item></channel></rss>

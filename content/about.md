## Naoaki Kanazawa

I am a Ph.D. student in [JSK Robotics Laboratory](http://www.jsk.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ ) at The University of Tokyo.

I am researching intelligent robots that can perform tasks in the real world, in order to realize a future where robots work in various places such as homes, facilities, hotels, stores, and factories, and support human life and society.
Currently, I am focusing on life support robots, especially the recognition, action, planning, and learning of cooking support robots.
